  {
    myth: "Climate change is just a natural cycle.",
    fact: "While Earth’s climate has changed historically, the current warming is happening unusually fast and is strongly linked to human greenhouse gas emissions.",
    src: "https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/debunking-eight-common-myths-about-climate-change"
  },
  {
    myth: "There’s no scientific consensus on climate change.",
    fact: "Over 97% (or even 99%) of climate scientists agree that climate change is driven by human activities.",
    src: "https://www.preventionweb.net/news/10-climate-change-myths-debunked"
  },
  {
    myth: "CO₂ can’t be that bad — it’s such a small part of the atmosphere.",
    fact: "Even in small concentrations, CO₂ is a very powerful greenhouse gas, trapping heat and driving warming.",
    src: "https://hydroreform.org/2021/01/debunking-5-common-climate-change-myths/"
  },
  {
    myth: "The Sun’s changes are causing global warming.",
    fact: "Solar output has been relatively stable, while global temperatures continue to rise — greenhouse gases are the dominant factor.",
    src: "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/climate-change-myth"
  },
  {
    myth: "Climate models are unreliable — scientists can’t trust them.",
    fact: "Climate models have consistently predicted major trends accurately; many models developed decades ago match observed warming.",
    src: "https://hydroreform.org/2021/01/debunking-5-common-climate-change-myths/"
  },
  {
    myth: "Cold winters disprove global warming.",
    fact: "Short-term weather (like cold snaps) is not the same as long-term climate. Climate change refers to average conditions over decades.",
    src: "https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/debunking-eight-common-myths-about-climate-change"
  },
  {
    myth: "It’s too late to do anything; we should just adapt.",
    fact: "While adaptation is vital, many impacts are already irreversible; mitigation (cutting emissions) remains critical.",
    src: "https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/debunking-eight-common-myths-about-climate-change"
  },
  {
    myth: "Planting trees is enough to solve climate change.",
    fact: "Trees help absorb CO₂, but we still need to drastically reduce fossil fuel use — offsetting alone isn’t sufficient.",
    src: "https://www.wea.org.uk/news-views/blog/climate-change-debunking-key-myths-surrounding-global-warming"
  },
  {
    myth: "Ocean levels rising is exaggerated or not happening.",
    fact: "Sea level is rising due to melting ice and thermal expansion, and it's accelerating.",
    src: "https://climatefactchecks.org/debunking-commonn-myths-co%E2%82%82-sea-levels-and-the-reality-of-climate-change/"
  },
  {
    myth: "Geoengineering can fix climate change safely.",
    fact: "Geoengineering may help reduce temperatures, but it does not address root causes like CO₂ and has uncertain, potentially dangerous side‑effects.",
    src: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_weathering"
  },
  {
    myth: "Methane doesn’t matter because it breaks down quickly.",
    fact: "Methane is a potent greenhouse gas; leaks from fossil fuel extraction contribute significantly to warming.",
    src: "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07620"
  },
  {
    myth: "Ocean acidification isn’t a big deal; marine life will adapt.",
    fact: "Acidification disrupts marine ecosystems, affecting shells, coral reefs, and food chains.",
    src: "https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/"
  },
  {
    myth: "Permafrost thaw is slow and harmless.",
    fact: "Thawing permafrost releases both CO₂ and methane, creating strong feedback loops that accelerate warming.",
    src: "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07620"
  },
  {
    myth: "Energy from renewables cannot meet baseload demand.",
    fact: "With better grid design, storage, and a mix of renewable sources, it’s increasingly feasible to run reliable clean energy systems.",
    src: "https://climatecosmos.com/climate-science/10-climate-myths-that-experts-have-debunked/"
  },
  {
    myth: "Nuclear power is too unsafe to be a climate solution.",
    fact: "Modern nuclear technologies can support low-carbon electricity with strong safety records.",
    src: "https://www.wea.org.uk/news-views/blog/climate-change-debunking-key-myths-surrounding-global-warming"
  },
  {
    myth: "Carbon offsets mean I don’t need to reduce emissions.",
    fact: "Offsets help, but real emissions cuts are necessary — offsets should supplement, not replace, reduction efforts.",
    src: "https://www.wea.org.uk/news-views/blog/climate-change-debunking-key-myths-surrounding-global-warming"
  },
  {
    myth: "Only rich countries will feel the impacts of climate change.",
    fact: "Vulnerable countries are already facing extreme heat, food insecurity, and flooding — they often lack the resources to adapt.",
    src: "https://www.preventionweb.net/news/10-climate-change-myths-debunked"
  },
  {
    myth: "Extreme weather isn’t linked to climate change.",
    fact: "Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of events like heatwaves, heavy rainfall, and storms.",
    src: "https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/debunking-eight-common-myths-about-climate-change"
  },
  {
    myth: "Greenhouse gas emissions are inevitable; cutting now will destroy economies.",
    fact: "Investing in green infrastructure and clean energy creates economic opportunities. Inaction costs more than climate action.",
    src: "https://www.preventionweb.net/news/10-climate-change-myths-debunked"
  },
  {
    myth: "Water vapor is the most important greenhouse gas — CO₂ doesn’t matter much.",
    fact: "Water vapor amplifies warming, but CO₂ is what controls how much additional water vapor the atmosphere can hold.",
    src: "https://www.c2es.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/misconceptions-realities-climate-science-06-2012.pdf"
  },
  {
    myth: "Volcanoes emit more CO₂ than humans.",
    fact: "Human CO₂ emissions are far greater annually compared to volcanoes.",
    src: "https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/debunking-eight-common-myths-about-climate-change"
  },
  {
    myth: "Deforestation only affects wildlife, not climate.",
    fact: "Deforestation contributes massively to CO₂ emissions and destroys carbon sinks.",
    src: "https://www.ube.ac.uk/whats-happening/articles/climate-change-denial-myths/"
  },
  {
    myth: "Sea ice melt doesn’t contribute to sea-level rise.",
    fact: "Sea ice melt doesn’t raise sea levels, but melting land ice (glaciers, ice sheets) and thermal expansion do.",
