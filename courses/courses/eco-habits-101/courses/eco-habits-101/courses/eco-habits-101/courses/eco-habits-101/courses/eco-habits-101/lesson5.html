    <h1>🌍 Lesson 5: Your Daily Eco Glow-Up</h1>

    <p>
        This lesson is where everything you learned turns into a real-life lifestyle shift.  
        Environmental science says that <strong>small, repeated actions</strong> create the biggest long-term carbon reductions.
    </p>

    <h2>✨ The “Habit Loop” Explained (Scientific)</h2>
    <p>
        According to behavioral neuroscience, every habit has three parts:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cue</strong> → something triggers the habit</li>
        <li><strong>Action</strong> → the habit you do</li>
        <li><strong>Reward</strong> → your brain releases dopamine</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This means making eco habits “stick” isn't about motivation — it’s about rewiring your brain’s loop.
    </p>

    <h2>🧠 How to Make Eco Habits Automatic</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Put reusable bags near the door</strong> → cue</li>
        <li><strong>Carry a steel bottle every day</strong> → action</li>
        <li><strong>Cleaner room + less plastic guilt</strong> → reward</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Do this for 21–40 days and you literally reprogram your neural pathways.
    </p>

    <h2>🔥 10 Small Habits With HUGE Impact</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a reusable water bottle (cuts ~150 plastic bottles/year)</li>
        <li>5-minute showers (saves ~45 liters/day)</li>
        <li>Turn off lights when leaving the room</li>
        <li>Two plant-based meals a week (big carbon savings)</li>
        <li>No impulse buying (less waste)</li>
        <li>Use both sides of paper</li>
        <li>Walk short distances instead of using autos/cabs</li>
        <li>Switch to LED bulbs</li>
        <li>Recycle correctly (refer Lesson 4)</li>
        <li>Keep one “zero-waste day” every week</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🌟 The Gen Z Advantage</h2>
    <p>
        Gen Z is the most climate-aware generation ever.  
        UN reports show that <strong>72% of Gen Z actively want sustainable lifestyles</strong>.  
        That means every habit you adopt spreads to your friends/socials faster than any older generation.
    </p>

    <h2>📋 Mini Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        Create a “Daily Eco Checklist” with 3 habits from this course.  
        Follow it for one week and track how many days you complete all three.
