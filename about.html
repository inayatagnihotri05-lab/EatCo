    <div class="about-text">
      <p>From tiramisu to delicate macarons, I’ve always been a foodie at heart. One day, while savoring a triple-layer chocolate cake, it hit me — every bite I take has an impact on the planet. That little “aha!” moment sparked EatCo 🌿, a space where sustainability meets deliciousness.</p>

      <p>I’ve had quite the journey so far — studying in Australia for a while before moving back to India, navigating new schools, new cultures, and still managing to chase my passions. At 14, I balance my love for learning with a love for life: swimming laps, hitting the tennis court, and shooting hoops in basketball tournaments (yes, I have a few trophies to show for it!).</p>

      <p>Being an award-winning MUN’er and debater taught me how to think on my feet and challenge ideas boldly, while writing for the <em>Times of India</em> showed me the power of words in shaping change. I’m trilingual, constantly juggling languages like a pro, and I’ve leveled up my sustainability knowledge with multiple UNECE courses — think of it as earning real-world eco-XP. On top of that, I’m actively involved with the 1M1B Foundation, learning firsthand how youth can make a massive difference globally.</p>

      <p>EatCo is my way of turning all these lessons, experiences, and quirks into something tangible — a community where every snack, every meal, and every choice counts. If I can start this journey at 14, imagine what YOU could do next! 🌱</p>
