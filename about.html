    <h1 class="mag-title">Meet the Founder — <span class="highlight">Inayat Agnihotri</span></h1>

    <div class="section">
      I’ve always been that kid who could go from devouring a perfect tiramisu to arguing passionately about saving the planet — and yes, my political opinions are strong enough to start debates at absolutely any family gathering. No in-between. One day, somewhere between a matcha cheesecake and a slice of wood-fired truffle pizza, it hit me: <strong>If I love food this much, why not make the world eat better too?</strong> And just like that, EatCo sparked into life.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      I grew up studying in Australia, shifting between countries, schools, accents, and entire ecosystems of people. Now at 14, living in India, it feels like I’ve borrowed the best from both worlds — and somehow they fit together perfectly.
    </div>

    <div class="quote">"Passion for food. Loud opinions. Sustainability obsession. Everything mixed into one wild Gen Z starter pack."</div>

    <div class="section">
      I’m an MUN’er — debating since I was seven — sharp enough to convince judges, teachers, and occasionally myself. I’ve written for the Times of India, learning early that words can shift minds, entertain people, or make the room go silent. I’ve even learned how to work with AI — not rely on it blindly — treating it like a calculator, a map, or a sneaky bonus tool. <strong>Teamwork, not dependency.</strong>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      Along the way, I completed multiple courses with UNECE and got active with the <span class="highlight">1M1B Foundation</span>, discovering that Gen Z can do more than repost climate infographics — we can actually build things that matter.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      Outside academics, I’m 5'5 — and yes, the weather down here is amazing. I swim endless laps, smash forehands like I’m auditioning for Wimbledon, and have even played basketball despite not being the tallest one on the court. When I’m not doing all that, my AirPods are blasting house music and hip-hop like they’re my second heartbeat.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      I genuinely love academic excellence — not in the “study 12 hours a day” vibe, but in the "my brain is nosy and wants to know literally everything" way. School subjects, sustainability, global issues, writing, politics, random facts — that’s my happy place.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      EatCo is my way of blending food lovers, planet protectors, and curious Gen Z kids who want sustainability without the boring textbook energy. It’s where flavour meets planet-care — fun, modern, relatable.
    </div>

    <div class="footer-tag">And trust me — I’m just getting started. 💚</div>
