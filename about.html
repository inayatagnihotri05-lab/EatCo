    <h1>Meet the Founder — Inayat Agnihotri</h1>
    <p>
      Meet the Founder — Inayat Agnihotri — the sort of person who could be blasting Kanye West one minute and making people go crazy with her political opinions the next. Between devouring a perfect cheesecake and hot chocolate with at least four marshmallows, it hit me: if I love food this much, why not make the world eat better too? And just like that, EatCo came to life!
    </p>
    <p>
      Growing up between Australia and India, switching schools, accents, and entire ecosystems, I’ve borrowed the best from both worlds — and somehow made them fit together perfectly. Inayat is the person who brings Russian literature existentialism, Shashi Tharoor-level sarcastic vocab, highly censored political opinions, and an elite music taste to the table — and with EatCo, all of that energy gets channeled into something meaningful and fun.

      Many regions in India are facing a food crisis — over-reliance on unhealthy processed food, rising food waste, and unsustainable farming practices which has a terrible impact on farmers. EatCo tackles this head-on by promoting mindful eating, reducing waste, and encouraging healthy, local, and sustainable choices!
